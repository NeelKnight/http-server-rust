This is my first ever Rust Project!

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the
protocol that powers the web. In this project, I have experimented with HTTP/1.1, building a server that is capable of serving multiple clients and offering some specific endpoints.

For learning about TCP servers, I consumed information from here:
(https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html)

This is a starting point for Rust solutions to the
["Build Your Own HTTP server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview)
