This is my first ever Rust Project!

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) protocol powers the web. In this project, I experiment with HTTP/1.1, building a server that is capable of serving multiple clients and offering some specific endpoints.

For learning about TCP servers, I consumed information from here:
(https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html)

**Note**: This was part of a ["Build Your Own HTTP server"](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview) Challenge hosted by [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io).
